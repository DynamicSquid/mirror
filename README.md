# mirror

A neat little language. Transpiles down to C++, statically typed, and strong. It isn't much, but this is the first time I used Rust.

To build it from source, you'll need a Rust compiler, a C++ compiler, and some way to run a Bash script. Or you could just use [repl.it](https://repl.it), which is what I used. Just import this GitHub project into repl.it and you're all set! Just make sure to create a new file called `source.mir` where you'll write your actual code.
